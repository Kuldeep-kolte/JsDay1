    <h1>Day 5</h1>
    <h4>Q.1 What is the for-in loop in JavaScript? Give its syntax</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>The for...in loop is used to loop through an object's properties. </li>
        <li>
            <pre>Syntax
The syntax of ‘for..in’ loop is −

        for (key in object) {
            // code block to be executed
        }</pre>
        </li>
        <li>In each iteration, one property from object is assigned to variablename and this loop continues till all the
            properties of the object are exhausted.</li>
        <li>Example:</li>
        <pre>
            const person = {fname:"John", lname:"Doe", age:25};
            let text = "";
            for (let x in person) {
            text += person[x];
            } 
        </pre>
    </ul>
    <h4>Q.2 Explain Local Scope, Block Scope, Functional Scope and Scope Chain in javascript</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Scope determines the accessibility (visibility) of variables.</li>
        <li>JavaScript has 3 types of scope:
            Block scope
            Function scope/Local scope
            Global scope
        </li>
        <ul>
            <li>Block scope</li>
            <li>Before ES6 (2015), JavaScript had only Global Scope and Function Scope.

                ES6 introduced two important new JavaScript keywords: let and const.

                These two keywords provide Block Scope in JavaScript.

                Variables declared inside a { } block cannot be accessed from outside the block:</li>
            <pre>
                {
                    let x = 2;
                }
                  // x can NOT be used here </pre>
            <li>Variables declared with the var keyword can NOT have block scope.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>Function scope/Local scope</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Variables declared within a JavaScript function, become LOCAL to the function.</li>
            <pre>// code here can NOT use carName

    function myFunction() {
        let carName = "Volvo";
        // code here CAN use carName
    }
                
    // code here can NOT use carName </pre>
            <li>

                Local variables have Function Scope:

                They can only be accessed from within the function.
            </li>
            <li>Local variables are created when a function starts, and deleted when the function is completed.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>Global JavaScript Variables</li>
        <ul>
            <li>A variable declared outside a function, becomes GLOBAL.</li>
            <pre>let carName = "Volvo";
// code here can use carName
                
function myFunction() {
// code here can also use carName
}</pre>
            <li>

                A global variable has Global Scope:

                All scripts and functions on a web page can access it.
            </li>
            <li>Variables declared Globally (outside any function) have Global Scope.</li>
            <li>Global variables can be accessed from anywhere in a JavaScript program.

                Variables declared with var, let and const are quite similar when declared outside a block.

                They all have Global Scope:</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <h4>Q.3 What is difference between null and undefined and where to use what?</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Null: It is the intentional absence of the value. It is one of the primitive values of JavaScript.</li>
        <dl>
            <dt>Null</dt>
            <dd>The value null represents the absence of any object value</dd>
            <dd>It is Primitive value in Javascript</dd>
        </dl>
        <li>Undefined: It means the value does not exist in the compiler. It is the global object.</li>
        <dl>
            <dt>Undefined</dt>
            <dd>The undefined property indicates that a variable has not been declared at all.</dd>
            <dd>It is a global property.</dd>
        </dl>
    </ul>
    <h4>Q.4 what is symbol in javascript</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>The JavaScript ES6 introduced a new primitive data type called Symbol. Symbols are immutable (cannot be
            changed) and are unique. For example,</li>
        <li>Symbol is a built-in object whose constructor returns a symbol primitive — also called a Symbol value or
            just a Symbol — that's guaranteed to be unique.</li>
        <li>You use the Symbol() function to create a Symbol. For example,</li>
        <pre>const x = Symbol('hey');
console.log(x); // Symbol(hey)</pre>
    </ul>
    <h4>Q.5 Write code to explain map and filter in arrays</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Map, reduce, and filter are all array methods in JavaScript. Each one will iterate over an array and perform
            a transformation or computation. Each will return a new array based on the result of the function.</li>
        <li>Map()</li>
        <dd>The map() method is used for creating a new array from an existing one, applying a function to each one of
            the elements of the first array.</dd>
        <li>Syntax:</li>
        <pre>var new_array = arr.map(function callback(element, index, array) {
            // Return value for new_array
        }[, thisArg])</pre>
        <li>Example:</li>
        <pre>const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
const doubled = numbers.map(item => item * 2);
console.log(doubled); // [2, 4, 6, 8]</pre>
        <li>Filter()</li>
        <dd>The filter() method takes each element in an array and it applies a conditional statement against it. If
            this conditional returns true, the element gets pushed to the output array. If the condition returns false,
            the element does not get pushed to the output array. </dd>
        <li>Syntax:</li>
        <pre>var new_array = arr.filter(function callback(element, index, array) {
        // Return true or false
    }[, thisArg])</pre>
        <li>Example:</li>
        <pre>const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
const evens = numbers.filter(item => item % 2 === 0);
console.log(evens); // [2, 4]</pre>
        <li>Reduce()</li>
        <dd>The reduce() method reduces an array of values down to just one value. To get the output value, it runs a
            reducer function on each element of the array.</dd>
        <li>Syntax:-</li>
        <pre>arr.reduce(callback[, initialValue])</pre>
        <li>Example:-</li>
        <pre>const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
const sum = numbers.reduce(function (result, item) {
    return result + item;
}, 0);
console.log(sum); // 10</pre>
    </ul>
    <h4>Q.6 Explain passed by value and passed by reference</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Call By Value:</li>
        <dd>In Pass by value, function is called by directly passing the value of the variable as an argument. So any
            changes made inside the function does not affect the original value.</dd>
        <dd>In Pass by value, parameters passed as an arguments create its own copy. So any changes made inside the
            function is made to the copied value not to the original value .</dd>
        <pre>
            let num1 = 70
            let num2 = num1
            
            console.log(num1) // 70
            console.log(num2) // 70
            
            num1 = 40
            
            console.log(num1) // 40
            console.log(num2) // 70
            </pre>
        <li>Pass by Reference: </li>
        <dd>In Pass by Reference, Function is called by directly passing the reference/address of the variable as an
            argument. So changing the value inside the function also change the original value. In JavaScript array and
            Object follows pass by reference property.

            In Pass by reference, parameters passed as an arguments does not create its own copy, it refers to the
            original value so changes made inside function affect the original value. </dd>
        <pre>
            let originalObj = {
                name: "Scaler Academy",
                rating: 4.5,
                topic: "JavaScript"
                };
                
                function demo(tmpObj) { 
                  tmpObj.rating = 5; 
                  console.log(tmpObj.rating); 
                } 
                
                console.log(originalObj.rating);    // 4.5
                demo(originalObj);             // 5
                console.log(originalObj.rating);    //5
        </pre>
    </ul>
    <h4>Q.7 Please explain Self Invoking Function and its code</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>A self-invoking (also called self-executing) function is a nameless (anonymous) function that is invoked
            immediately after its definition.</li>
        <li> An anonymous function is enclosed inside a set of parentheses followed by another set of parentheses () ,
            which does the execution.</li>
            <pre>(function(){
                console.log(Math.PI);
            })();</pre>
    </ul>
