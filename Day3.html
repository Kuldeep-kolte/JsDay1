    <h2>Day 3</h2>
    <h4>Q.1 What is the use of setTimeout</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>The setTimeout() method executes a block of code after the specified time. The method executes the code only
            once.
        </li>
        <li>A function to be executed after the timer expires.</li>
        <li>Syntax</li>
        <ul>
            setTimeout(function, milliseconds);
            <li> Its parameters are:</li>
            <li>function - a function containing a block of code</li>
            <li>milliseconds - the time after which the function is executed</li>
        </ul>

        <pre>
    The setTimeout() method returns an intervalID, which is a positive integer.
    Example 1: Display a Text Once After 3 Second

    // program to display a text using setTimeout method
    function greet() {
    console.log('Hello world');
    }

    setTimeout(greet, 3000);
    console.log('This message is shown first');
</pre>
        <li>setTimeout() is an asynchronous function, meaning that the timer function will not pause execution of other
            functions in the functions stack.</li>
        <li>The setTimeout() method calls a function after a number of milliseconds. 1 second = 1000 milliseconds.</li>
        <li>The setTimeout() is executed only once.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Q.2 What is an event loop and call stack</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>The event loop is a constantly running process that monitors both the callback queue and the call stack.
        </li>
        <li>If the call stack is not empty, the event loop waits until it is empty and places the next function from the
            callback queue to the call stack.</li>
        <li>Call stack</li>
        <ul>
            <li>You've probably already heard that JavaScript is single-threaded. But what does this mean?
                JavaScript can do one single thing at a time because it has only one call stack.</li>
            <li>Every time a script or function calls a function, it's added to the top of the call stack. Every time
                the function exits, the interpreter removes it from the call stack.</li>
            <pre>
        const addOne = (value) => value + 1;
        const addTwo = (value) => addOne(value + 1);
        const addThree = (value) => addTwo(value + 1);
        const calculation = () => {
        return addThree(1) + addTwo(2);
        };
        calculation();</pre>
            <li>Every time a function calls another function, it's added to the top of the stack, on top of the calling
                function.
                The order in which the stack processes each function call follows the LIFO principle (Last In, First
                Out).</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <h4>Q.3 What are arrow functions?</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Arrow function is one of the features introduced in the ES6 version of JavaScript. It allows you to create
            functions in a cleaner way compared to regular functions.</li>
        <li>Example</li>
        <pre>
        hello = () => {
            return "Hello World!";
        } 
        </pre>
        <li>Arrow functions allow us to write shorter function syntax:</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Q.4 What is a Temporal Dead Zone?</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>The let and const variables are not accessible before they are initialized with some value, and the phase
            between the starting of the execution of block in which the let or const variable is declared till that
            variable is being initialized is called Temporal Dead Zone for the variable.</li>
        <li>Example 1: In this example, we are simply using a javascript code snippet and using the var keyword to see
            how the memory allocation takes place.</li>
        <li>Variables defined with let are also hoisted to the top of the block, but not initialized.</li>
        <pre>
        console.log(x);
        var x = 6;
        console.log(x);
        </pre>
    </ul>
    <h4>Q.5 What is hoisting?</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>JavaScript Hoisting refers to the process whereby the interpreter appears to move the declaration of
            functions, variables or classes to the top of their scope, prior to execution of the code.</li>
        <li>Hoisting allows functions to be safely used in code before they are declared.</li>
        <li>In JavaScript, a variable can be declared after it has been used.
            In other words; a variable can be used before it has been declared.</li>
        <pre>
                    x = 5; // Assign 5 to x
                    var x; // Declare x 
                </pre>
    </ul>
    <h4>Q.6 What is the DOM?</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>When a web page is loaded, the browser creates a Document Object Model of the page.
            The HTML DOM model is constructed as a tree of Objects:</li>
        <li>The document object is a property of the window object.The document object is accessed with:window.document
            or just document</li>
        <li>The W3C Document Object Model (DOM) is a platform and language-neutral interface that allows programs and
            scripts to dynamically access and update the content, structure, and style of a document.</li>
            <img src="DOM TREE.gif" alt="" style="width: 800px; height: 400px;">
    </ul>
    <h4>Q.7 Difference between undefined vs not defined vs NaN</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>In JavaScript, they both are related to memory space and there is a very simple difference between them.
        </li>
        <li>Not defined :- If the variable name which is being accessed doesn't exist in memory space then it would be
            not defined,
            It works like when we did not declare the variable and try to call that variable.
        </li>
        <li>Undefined :- It works like when we declared a variable in the code but did not assign the value before
            printing the variable value</li>
        <pre>var a = 5;
console.log(a);
console.log(b);</pre>
        <pre>
        Output:
                “Reference Error” with a message of “b is not defined“.
</pre>
        <pre>console.log(a);
    var a = 5;
    console.log(a);</pre>
        <pre>
    Output (In console):
    undefined
    5
            </pre>
        <li>In JavaScript, NaN is short for "Not-a-Number".</li>
        <li>In JavaScript, NaN is a number that is not a legal number.The Global NaN property is the same as the
            Number.NaN property.</li>
    </ul>
