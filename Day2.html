    <h1>Day 2</h1>
    <h4>Q.1 What is creation phase and execution phase?</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Each execution context has two phases: the creation phase and the execution phase.</li>
        <li>During the creation phase of the execution context, JS allocates memory space for the functions and
            variables.</li>
        <li>In case of functions, the whole function body is stored but in case of the variables, it is declared and
            assigned a default value undefined. This phenomena is called Hoisting.</li>
        <li>In execution phase, JS executes our code line by line and assigns the value to the variables. </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Q.2 What are objects in javascript?</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>JavaScript objects are containers for named values called properties. </li>
        <li>Objects are variables too. But objects can contain many values. </li>
        <li>This code assigns many values (Fiat, 500, white) to a variable named car:</li>
        <pre>const car = 
            {type:"Fiat",
             model:"500", 
             color:"white"
            };</pre>
        <li>The values are written as name:value pairs (name and value separated by a colon).</li>
        <li>The name:values pairs in JavaScript objects are called properties:</li>
        <li>It is a common practice to declare objects with the const keyword.</li>
        <li>There are three different ways of creating object</li>
        <ol>
            <li>Object Literal:</li>
            <pre>
                let obj = {
                        name : 'Hardik',
                        age  : 22
                    }
                console.log(obj.name);
            </pre>
            <li>creating instance of object</li>
            <pre>
                let obj1 = new Object();
                obj1.name = "John";
                obj1.age = 25;
            </pre>
            <li>Object Constructor or Function Constructor</li>
            <pre>
                function obj(name,age){
                    this.name = name;
                    this.age;
                }
                let obj2 = new Obj("keshav",24)
            </pre>
        </ol>
    </ul>
    <h4>Q.3 What are function constructors?</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Every object in JavaScript has a built-in property, which is called its prototype. The prototype is itself
            an object, so the prototype will have its own prototype, making what's called a prototype chain. The chain
            ends when we reach a prototype that has null for its own prototype.</li>
        <li>Function is said to be constructor when it is used to initialize and create a instance of class that is also
            called as "object"</li>
        <li>It is considered good practice to name constructor functions with an upper-case first letter.</li>
        <li>In a constructor function this does not have a value. It is a substitute for the new object. The value of
            this will become the new object when a new object is created.</li>
        <pre>
                function Person(first, last, age, eye) {
                    this.firstName = first;
                    this.lastName = last;
                    this.age = age;
                    this.eyeColor = eye;
                  }
                  const myFather = new Person("John", "Doe", 50, "blue");
            </pre>
        <li>The way to create an "object type", is to use an object constructor function.
            In the example above, function Person() is an object constructor function.
            Objects of the same type are created by calling the constructor function with the new keyword</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Q.4 Explain prototypes</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>prototype is itself an object that have prototype object present inside it</li>
        <li>All JavaScript objects inherit properties and methods from a prototype.</li>
        <pre>
            function Person(first, last, age, eyecolor) {
                this.firstName = first;
                this.lastName = last;
                this.age = age;
                this.eyeColor = eyecolor;
              }
              
              const myFather = new Person("John", "Doe", 50, "blue");
              const myMother = new Person("Sally", "Rally", 48, "green");
        </pre>
        <li>you can not add a new property to an existing object constructor.To add a new property to a constructor, you
            must add it to the constructor function</li>
        <li>The JavaScript prototype property allows you to add new properties to object constructors</li>
        <pre>
            function Person(first, last, age, eyecolor) {
                this.firstName = first;
                this.lastName = last;
                this.age = age;
                this.eyeColor = eyecolor;
              }
              
              Person.prototype.nationality = "English";
        </pre>
    </ul>
    <h4>Q.5 What is prototype chain</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>If a prototype value is changed, then all the new objects will have the changed property value. All the
            previously created objects will have the previous value. For example,</li>
        <pre>
            // constructor function
function Person() {
    this.name = 'John'
}

// add a property
Person.prototype.age = 20;

// creating an object
const person1 = new Person();

console.log(person1.age); // 20

// changing the property value of prototype
Person.prototype = { age: 50 }

// creating new object
const person3 = new Person();

console.log(person3.age); // 50
console.log(person1.age); // 20
        </pre>
    </ul>
    <h4>Q.6 Give an example of inheritance using function constructor</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Inheriting a previously defined constructor function means using the parameters of the previously defined
            function along with adding some new parameters to the newly defined constructor function. For this, we need
            to use the call() function which allows us to call a function defined somewhere else in the current context.
        </li>
        <pre>Syntax:
        myFunction.call( this, property1, property2, ... , propertyN )
    </pre>
        <pre>
        function Employee(name, age, gender, id) {
            this.name = name;
            this.age = age;
            this.gender = gender;
            this.id = id;
        };
  
        function Developer(name, age, gender, id, specialization) {
  
            // Calling Employee constructor function
            Employee.call(this, name, age, gender, id);
  
            // Adding a new parameter
            this.specialization = specialization;
        }
  
        // Creating objects
        let Employee1 = new Employee("Suraj", 28, "Male", 564);
        let Developer1 = new Developer("Karishma", 31, "Female", 345,
            "Frontend Developer");
        console.log(Employee1);
        console.log(Developer1);
    </pre>
    </ul>
    <h4>Q.7 What are callbacks?</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>A callback is a function passed as an argument to another function
            This technique allows a function to call another function
            A callback function can run after another function has finished</li>
            <pre>Example:
                function myDisplayer(some) {
                    document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = some;
                  }
                  
                  function myCalculator(num1, num2, myCallback) {
                    let sum = num1 + num2;
                    myCallback(sum);
                  }
                  
                  myCalculator(5, 5, myDisplayer);
            </pre>
            <li>In the example above, myDisplayer is the name of a function. <br>

                It is passed to myCalculator() as an argument. <br>
                
                When you pass a function as an argument, remember not to use parenthesis.
        
                Right: myCalculator(5, 5, myDisplayer);</li>
    </ul>
